QA Cinema project notes
=======================

Roles
-----
* Product owner: Lloyd
* Scrum master: Kieran
* Developer: Lukasz
* Developer: Ryan

## Week zero

### Friday
We assigned roles and created our Jira board. The product owner decided that one story point would roughly correspond to one hour of effort.
We aggreed to the following style conventions:
* Feature branches to be named feature-developerName-description
* Pages should be named in flat case i.e. all lower case, no separation between words
* IDs in the database should include the table name e.g. user_id, film_id etc.

We started our first sprint and assigned the following task groups:
* Lloyd: site-wide navbar and screens page
* Kieran: ERD, opening times page and logo
* Lukasz: about page
* Ryan: Risk assessment and home page

## Week one

### Monday
In our morning meeting we discussed what we were planning to do today. Lukasz indentified a blocker in his about page, that he needed the other team members to send him a brief description. We agreed to do that today.

Ryan started work on the places to go page. He suggested that we don't bother with a database backing the places as it would add unneccessary complication and we agreed. We will need to modify the ERD to reflect the change.

We decided that we would create a css file to manage site-wide formatting and design.

### Tuesday
In our morning meeting we identified as a blocker the need for a user database (and a log-in page) since that is needed to do the discussion board and booking system.

Kieran decided to start on the user database and log-in page, but we didn't know exactly how long that was likely to take. Lloyd is working on the listings gallery, Ryan is continuing on the places to go page and Lukasz is continuing on the about page.
